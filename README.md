Final Project
**Animal Detection and Classification using RF-DETR**
This repository provides the complete implementation of the Receptive Field DETR (RF-DETR) model tailored for detecting and classifying multiple animal classes from images. The system leverages a receptive field enhancement module, CNN backbone, and Transformer encoder-decoder for end-to-end object detection on a custom COCO JSON dataset sourced from Roboflow.
